Simulated REST API for managing event data using pure HTML, JavaScript and JSON. Designed to emulate API behavior without needing a server.

## React + TypeScript Integration

To reinforce architectural thinking and front-end capabilities, a new SPA was developed using React and TypeScript.  
It consumes the core event data:

- Component-based structure (`<EventList />`)
- Strong typing with interfaces
- Separation of concerns (data, presentation)
- Easy scalability and modularity

## How to Run
